# touhou-on-fpga
A Touhou Project-style bullet hell game for the Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA development board. Our final project for our ECE 385 (Digital Systems Laboratory) class during the fall semester of 2022.

Arrow keys to move, hold Shift to move slower, hold Z to shoot your laser, tap X to use a spellcard and clear the screen. Don't touch the bullets!

Students do their best now and are coding. Please wait warmly...
